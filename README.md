### Hello!

I am Roberto, a freelance software engineer from Mexico with a passion for learning. Welcome to my profile!

<!--
You may also find my CV in [English]() and [Spanish]().

## About Me

My favorite way to learn is by doing, be it trying to solve a problem or actively implementing newly acquired knowledge. This often involves reading documentation, research, and experimentation; These are skills I have refined during academic, professional, and personal projects. Being put in charge of unfamiliar systems and applications with no documentation has also made me flexible and patient. Frequent cooperation with diverse co-workers from varied professional backgrounds has also given me broad communication and interpersonal skills.

### Programming languages I know

The following list is in no particular order, but I feel most confident with Python, C, C#, and web development languages like Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

* Python 3
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* C
* C++
* C#
* PHP
* SQL
* Java
* Clojure
* VBA
* Bash
* PowerShell

### Skills

* Full stack development
* Google Cloud's Firebase and Firestore
* Googling / Google dorks
* Mobile development (native Android and hybrid webapps)
* Process automation and tool development
* Sharepoint
* PowerApps
* API creation
* Microsoft Office
* Linux use and management
* Game development (mostly Unity)
* Writing, communication
* Embedded software
* No-SQL (MongoDB, Neo4j)

Skills I have base knowledge in, but would like to improve on

* Pentesting (scanning, research, vuln exploitation)
* DB administration
* Networking
* Computer graphics

<!--
### Projects / repos
* [Primeheim](https://primeheim.ch) - I built this site in ReactJS based on a design provided by a client and implemented everything from the front and back end. This site is in active development.
* ChopWare (now with secrets!)
* 

If you find a repo of mine that is not listed here, it is probably just not a completed project or not something I am proud of

### I also like learning (human) languages!
* Spanish (native tongue)
* English (native proficiency)
* Japanese (conversational)
* French (conversational)
* German (beginner)


### Hobbies

* Programming challenges <!-- (here is my (Hackerrank profile)[]!) -->
* Wargames/CTF
  * I love OverTheWire's challanges. I'm on level 14 of Banit and level 11 of Natas
  * I recently got into HackTheBox Academy
  * I want to get into competitive CTFs! Unfortunately, I have not had a lot of free time in the past few months
* Reading - An old love of mine. I prefer novels, but I also find history fascinating
* Sports - Karate and running

### Things I want to learn more about / work on more actively

* Cybersecurity
  * Reverse engineering
  * Packet analysis
  * Pentesting techniques and methodologies (physical pentesting as well!)
  * Some blue teaming, for what good is knowing an attack if you are vulnerable to it?
* Game development - I have made a few small games on Unity, but someday I hope to release a full-fledged game that I can be proud of.
* AR - I genuinely think augmented reality is the future. I think once it's accessible enough, this tech will be as ubiquitous as smart phones are today. I hope to become a part of the driving force that takes it there.
* Contribute to open source projects
* 3D modeling
